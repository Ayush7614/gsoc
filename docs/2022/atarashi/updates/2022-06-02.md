### Discussions

- Created one [pr](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi/pull/99) and get it merged
- Had a discussion on logistic regression model and we are going to implement it
- Created a collab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VTyCtR3c-1XiFNbD1WPXERgVuRLYJRTV?usp=sharing) for simple implementation of lr model and get it tested on atarashi agent locally

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Will try to optimize the model parameters
- Learn and try out different ways of using the trained model:
  - Either training part can be done in [atarashi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi) itself 
  - Or we can use separate repo for training purpose
- Discuss different models with mentors
