### Discussions

- Was majorly working on model training and improving the accuracy. Last week
  I was geeting the accuracy of 56% for logistic regression model, now after
  some modification model accuracy is increased to 59%.
- Also tried some other supervised learning models like RandomForest and lsvm.
- And had a discussion with mentors regarding where the training scripts should
  be kept and we came to conclusion that the model should be trained in our
  [Minerva](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation) repo itself
  and [Atarashi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi) will just have to import
  the model binary from there.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Will explore some semantic similarity models for text classification
- Also try to improve accuracy further
