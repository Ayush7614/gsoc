### Discussions

- Raised **PR's** on both [Minerva](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation) and
  [Atarashi](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi)
  - [Add agent for logistic regression model](https://github.com/fossology/atarashi/pull/100)
  - [feat(package): Add logreg package](https://github.com/fossology/Minerva-Dataset-Generation/pull/5)
- Started working on creating the packages for the trained model. For example the folder structure for
  **LogisticRegression** model should look like:

              └── logreg
                  ├── MANIFEST.in
                  ├── README.md
                  ├── setup.py
                  └── src
                      ├── LICENSE
                      ├── logreg
                      │   ├── data
                      │   │   └── logreg
                      │   └── __init__.py
                      └── model_train.py

- Implemented [Linear support vector machine](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html)
  model on dataset and got the accuracy of **63%**

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Will create the [python package](https://pypi.org/) for both models that
  has been implemented till now.
