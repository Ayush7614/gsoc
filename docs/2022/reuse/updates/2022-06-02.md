### Discussions

- **How should licenses and copyrights be applied to files without licenses or copyrights?**

    - Use GPL 2.0-only license for such files without copyright.

- **Do I need to create a Wiki Page for the REUSE Standard?**

    - Yes. You can implement it in 2 ways: i) By creating a separate wiki page ii) By adding in `fossology/CONTRIBUTING.md`

- **Do I need to add the current year to the copyright?**

    - No. Since we are not changing any logic in the file, we shouldn't change the copyright year.

- **How to add license and copyright in JSON files?**

    - JSON is for data only, and if you include a comment, then it will be data too. The `file-name.json.license` file needs to be created to add the license and copyright.

- **Can we have more than one license for a file?**

    - Yes, itâ€™s possible. You can use SPDX syntax to define them.
    For example: 
    SPDX-License-Identifier: (GPL-2.0 OR MIT)
    SPDX-License-Identifier: (LGPL-2.1 AND BSD-2-CLAUSE)

- **Should I change the year ranges?**

    - Concerning the year ranges, we should not change the existing year ranges(and not change the end year if no substantial modification was done in the file).

- Do not modify testdata files.
### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Implement discussed solution in upcoming week.
