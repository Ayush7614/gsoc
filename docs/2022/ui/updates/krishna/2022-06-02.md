## Meeting 1 _(June 2nd, 2022)_

GSOC 2022 first weekly update meeting during community bonding period.

<!-- truncate -->

### Discussions

- Different topics were discussed related to the projects.
- Separate project discussion with mentors were done.
- Different meeting timings for separate project discussions were decided.
- Timing for the reactUI project updates is decided to be on **Tuesday, 8:00pm to 9:00pm IST**.
- Docusaurus tool was explained by the mentors for documenting the weekly updates for fossology.

### Contributions so far

- [**#209** Removal of credentials for the REST API](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/209)
- [**#196** Disabled deletion for default users](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/196)

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- During the remaining time of community bonding I will be learning more about php development so that the learning curve can be reduced later when I'll start the development of the REST APIs later in the coding period.

- There are small fixes that needs to be done on the reactUI project to make the dev environment clean. SO I'll be putting some PRs related to that soon.
