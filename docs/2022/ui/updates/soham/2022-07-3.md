## Horizontal Pagination implementation

_(June 25th, 2022)_

Implementation of the horizontal page navigator. The pagination module fetches the data from the API on page basis thus reducing the response time of the API.

The All Recent Jobs page with the new Pagination module: <br/>
![pagination](/img/reactUI/pagination.png)

The Module also contains a text box so that user can directly navigate to that particular page at once.
This was suggested by one of the mentors and was implemented after.

### PR link - [feat(ui): horizontal pagination added in allRecentJobs](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/235)

## /jobs API

Started modifying the /jobs API and currently making a demo docuentation so that the flow of the APIs can be made clear. The API was discussed in the meeting and mentor asked to implement it in a certain suitable way.

Current response of the API: <br/>
![jobs_res](/img/reactUI/jobs_res.png)

Mentors asked to take the user ID as a parameter and not in the URL itself. In addition to this there were suggested changes in the endpoint names and processes which are yet to be implemented.

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Currently will be completing the doc related to the API development in order to clear the flow of the upcoming APIs
- Implementing the same Pagination module to the `/browse` page, Thus making navigation easier in that page too.
