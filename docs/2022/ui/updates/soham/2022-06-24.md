## All Recent Jobs Page

_(June 16th, 2022)_

Implementation of the All Recent Jobs page in the UI started.
The response from the `/jobs` endpoint was used in order to get the data from the backend server

Response format of the API: <br/>

At first `MDBReact` datatable was used to render the data but further discussions on optimising the page the idea was scrapped and `X-Total-pages` header was used to get the data from the server in already paginated form.

Final UI of the All Recent jobs page after the discussions looks like: <br/>

## My Recent Jobs Page

The same API endpoint was used in My Recent Jobs page and the logged in user's UID was fetched from the `getUserSelf()` function.
`MDBReact` table was used here and this requires change to the same UI as of `/allRecentJobs` page.

## Search in Browse Page

There was a search-bar present in the Browse page but, there was no function implented to make the search work. Thus introduced a search function which filters the API response as per the query data and only renders the value which is asked by the user.

### PR link - [fix(browse): search bar function implemented ](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI/pull/230)

### Conclusion and Further Plans

- Currently will be impleneting the My Recent Jobs page and will be introducing a row style pagination navigator as discussed with the mentors.
- The REST API for `/jobs` endpoint also needs a rework as it needs to send the processes as a subgroup of its respective job rather than sending all the processes at once.
- Other filters in the Browse page aslo needs to be implemented as the UI is ready but there is no funtion implemented.
